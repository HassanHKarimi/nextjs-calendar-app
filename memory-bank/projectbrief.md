# Project Brief: Next.js Calendar App

## Overview
A calendar application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and inline styles (previously Tailwind CSS). The application provides different calendar views (day, week, month) for managing events.

## Core Requirements
- Multiple calendar views (day, week, month)
- Authentication system with demo mode
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Event creation, display, and management
- Static export mode deployment

## Technical Constraints
- Must use Next.js static export mode instead of server-side rendering
- Pages Router implementation (not App Router)
- Client-side authentication in demo mode
- Inline styles for UI components

## Deployment Requirements
- Static site generation with proper routing
- Support for both demo mode and database mode
- Compatible with Vercel deployment
- Environment variable configuration

## Goals
- Create a fully functional calendar application that works in static export mode
- Provide a clean, responsive user interface
- Implement proper authentication flow (demo or real)
- Enable event management across different calendar views
- Ensure robust deployment process
