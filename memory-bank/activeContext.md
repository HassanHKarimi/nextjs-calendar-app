# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Day and Week views have been implemented and integrated with the main calendar
- Navigation between views is now fully functional
- Event display and interaction is consistent across all views

## Recent Changes
- Added Day view with hourly grid and event display
- Added Week view with daily columns and hourly grid
- Implemented consistent navigation header across all views
- Added view switcher buttons with consistent styling
- Events now have hover effects and proper positioning in all views

## Next Steps
1. Implement event creation/editing in day and week views
2. Add drag-and-drop functionality for events
3. Improve event overlap handling in week view
4. Add time indicators and current time marker
5. Implement event recurrence

## Active Decisions
- Using inline styles for consistent styling across components
- Maintaining separate routes for each view (/calendar, /calendar/week, /calendar/day)
- Using consistent event color coding based on event type/title
- Implementing hover effects for better event interaction
- Using grid layout for time-based views

## Current Considerations
- Need to optimize performance for large number of events
- Consider adding mini-calendar for quick date navigation
- May need to implement event caching for better performance
- Consider adding keyboard navigation support
- Think about mobile responsiveness improvements

## Open Questions
- How to best handle hover effects for overlapping events
- Whether to add additional interactive features to events
- If additional information should be displayed on hover
- How to maintain performance with hover effects on mobile devices
