# Active Context: Next.js Calendar App

## Current Work Focus
- Enhancing event display with interactive hover effects across all calendar views
- Maintaining consistent styling and behavior between day, week, and month views
- Implementing TypeScript interfaces for events to ensure type safety
- Fine-tuning UI interactions for better user experience

## Recent Changes
- Added hover effects to events in all calendar views (day, week, month)
- Implemented consistent hover styling with scale and shadow effects
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the week view with proper Event interface
- Enhanced event interactions with z-index management on hover
- Added position attributes to month view events to prevent layout issues

## Active Decisions
- Using modern UI components with simplified design
- Implementing event color coding based on event title/type
- Keeping consistent styling and interactions across different calendar views
- Using subtle scale and shadow effects for hover interactions
- Applying z-index changes on hover to bring events to the foreground

## Current Considerations
- Ensuring type safety across event handling components
- Maintaining consistent styling between day, week, and month views
- Optimizing event display in limited calendar cell space
- Ensuring responsive design works across various screen sizes
- Making sure hover effects work well in all calendar views

## Next Steps
- Review the EventModal component for potential enhancements
- Test hover effects across different browsers and devices
- Consider implementing similar effects for other interactive elements
- Review the event creation flow to ensure it matches the new UI
- Look for any other opportunities to enhance user interactions

## Open Questions
- How to best handle hover effects for overlapping events
- Whether to add additional interactive features to events
- If additional information should be displayed on hover
- How to maintain performance with hover effects on mobile devices
