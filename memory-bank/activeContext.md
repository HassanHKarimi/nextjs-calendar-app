# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Conducting major code cleanup and refactoring across the entire codebase
- Improving code organization and type safety throughout the application
- Converting remaining JavaScript files to TypeScript for consistency
- Standardizing component structures and patterns for better maintainability
- Enhancing performance through optimized rendering and state management

## Recent Changes
- Created dedicated CalendarDayCell component for month view
- Created dedicated CalendarEvent component for displaying events
- Implemented CSS classes for styling instead of inline styles
- Standardized Event type using the interface from event-utils
- Refactored MonthView to use the new component structure
- Updated WeekView and DayView to use the standard Event interface
- Added proper styling with CSS classes in month-view.css
- Fixed event filtering and display in all calendar views
- Implemented hover effects for calendar events
- Enhanced visual consistency across all views

## Next Steps
- Add proper CSS for WeekView and DayView components
- Break down large component files into smaller, more focused components
- Extract shared logic into reusable hooks and utilities
- Optimize event rendering and handling
- Standardize styling patterns across all components
- Enhance error handling and boundary implementation
- Improve accessibility for all interactive elements

## Active Decisions
- Using dedicated UI components (CalendarDayCell, CalendarEvent) for event display
- Centralizing view switching in the main calendar page
- Maintaining single source of truth for view switching via URL parameters
- Following consistent component hierarchy across all views
- Using CSS classes from dedicated stylesheet files for all views
- Moving to a standardized file naming and organization pattern
- Adopting consistent TypeScript practices for type safety
- Using event-utils for standardized Event interface

## Current Considerations
- How to best organize component files for maximum reusability
- Strategies for reducing duplication across view components
- Best practices for type definitions and interfaces
- Performance optimization techniques for event rendering
- Patterns for consistent error handling
- Approach for testing components after refactoring
- How to best handle event creation in different views
- How to optimize performance with potentially large event datasets
- What additional interactive features should be added to events
- How to enhance the user experience with keyboard navigation
- Whether to add mini-calendar for date selection

## Refactoring Plan
1. Improve code organization and structure
2. Enhance type safety across all components
3. Refactor large components into smaller, focused ones
4. Extract shared logic into reusable utilities
5. Optimize performance for rendering and state updates
6. Standardize styling patterns with Tailwind CSS
7. Implement proper error boundaries and handling

## Open Questions
- How to best handle event creation in different views?
- How to optimize performance with potentially large event datasets?
- What additional interactive features should be added to events?
- How to enhance the user experience with keyboard navigation?
- Whether to add mini-calendar for date selection?
