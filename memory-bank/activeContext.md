# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing single-page calendar with view switching
- Converting existing views to work within persistent container
- Maintaining state and context across view changes
- Ensuring smooth transitions between views

## Recent Changes
- Restructured navigation to use tab-based view switching
- Implemented persistent calendar container
- Consolidated view state management
- Added URL synchronization without page navigation
- Maintained consistent header across view changes

## Next Steps
1. Implement view components (Month/Week/Day) within container
2. Add smooth transitions between views
3. Implement shared event handling across views
4. Add URL deep linking support
5. Optimize view switching performance

## Active Decisions
- Using single-page architecture with view state management
- Maintaining persistent navigation and header
- Using URL parameters for deep linking without page navigation
- Implementing shared state management across views
- Using consistent styling across all view components

## Current Considerations
- Need to optimize performance for large number of events
- Consider adding mini-calendar for quick date navigation
- May need to implement event caching for better performance
- Consider adding keyboard navigation support
- Think about mobile responsiveness improvements

## Open Questions
- How to best handle hover effects for overlapping events
- Whether to add additional interactive features to events
- If additional information should be displayed on hover
- How to maintain performance with hover effects on mobile devices
