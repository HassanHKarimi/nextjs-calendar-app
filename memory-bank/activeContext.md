# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We are implementing a responsive calendar application with Next.js that supports month, week, and day views. The application is currently focused on improving the styling and component structure across all views.

### Recent Developments

1. **Component Refactoring**
   - Created dedicated UI components for calendar elements:
     - `CalendarDayCell` for rendering day cells in month view
     - `CalendarEvent` for consistent event display across all views
   - Implemented CSS classes for styling instead of inline styles
   - Added hover effects to calendar events for better user interaction

2. **Styling Improvements**
   - Established consistent styling patterns across all calendar views
   - Implemented color coding for events based on event type/title
   - Created responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox
   - Added visual indicators for today's date and current month

3. **View Implementation**
   - Month view fully refactored with component-based structure
   - Week and day views enhanced with consistent styling
   - Navigation between views working via URL parameters

## Current Decisions and Considerations

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Using a hierarchical component structure:
     - Main Calendar component handles view switching
     - View-specific components (MonthView, WeekView, DayView)
     - Shared UI components (CalendarDayCell, CalendarEvent)
   - Each component has well-defined responsibilities and props

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Using Tailwind CSS for utility classes
   - Component-specific CSS files for custom styling
   - Consistent color palette and spacing
   - Responsive design considerations for all views

3. **State Management**
   - URL parameters for view state (month/week/day)
   - React state for UI interactions
   - Context API for global state (authentication, events)

4. **Event Handling**
   - Event creation working in all views
   - Event display optimized for different views
   - Color coding based on event type/title

## Next Steps

1. **Complete UI Components**
   - Finalize any remaining UI components for calendar views
   - Ensure all components use consistent styling patterns
   - Validate responsiveness across different screen sizes

2. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Add tooltips or expanded views for calendar events
   - Implement better visual feedback for interactions
   - Optimize event display in limited space (month view)

3. **Additional Features**
   - Implement event editing functionality
   - Add event deletion support
   - Create drag-and-drop for event rescheduling

4. **Optimizations**
   - Improve performance for rendering large numbers of events
   - Optimize loading states and transitions between views
   - Enhance mobile experience

## Immediate Tasks

- Ensure all calendar views use the new component architecture
- Update any remaining inline styles to use CSS classes
- Validate that event display is consistent across all views
- Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Document the component structure and styling patterns
