## Current Status

The calendar application has made significant progress with all core views (month, week, day) implemented and functional. Recent work has focused on component refactoring and styling consistency, with the creation of dedicated UI components (`CalendarDayCell`, `CalendarEvent`) for better code organization and maintainability.

The application successfully handles event creation and display across all views, with proper color coding and visual formatting. Navigation between views and dates works correctly via URL parameters.

Current efforts are directed at ensuring all parts of the application follow consistent styling patterns using CSS classes instead of inline styles, completing the component architecture refactoring, and further enhancing the user experience with better responsiveness and visual feedback.

## Known Issues

- Event overlap handling in week/day views needs improvement
- Mobile responsiveness requires further testing and optimization
- Some components may still use inline styles instead of CSS classes
- Limited event display in month view cells (currently showing max 3 events)
- No keyboard navigation support
- Missing event editing and deletion functionality

## Recent Achievements
- ✅ Successfully refactored month view to use component-based structure
- ✅ Created dedicated CalendarDayCell component for month view
- ✅ Created dedicated CalendarEvent component for displaying events
- ✅ Standardized Event interface across the entire application
- ✅ Implemented CSS classes instead of inline styles
- ✅ Created dedicated CSS files for month, week, and day views
- ✅ Implemented beautiful pastel color scheme for events
- ✅ Fixed event filtering and display in all calendar views
- ✅ Enhanced hover effects with consistent scaling and shadow
- ✅ Standardized styling across all views (month, week, day)
- ✅ Improved day cell layout with proper aspect ratio for square cells
- ✅ Added consistent event color coding with left border accents
- ✅ Fixed z-index management for event hover effects

## Technical Debt
- Need to implement proper loading states and error handling
- Need to add accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
- Optimize component rendering to prevent unnecessary rerenders
- Add comprehensive testing for components and utilities
- Implement responsive design best practices for all screen sizes
- Refactor event creation modal for better UX and accessibility
- Optimize performance for large datasets
