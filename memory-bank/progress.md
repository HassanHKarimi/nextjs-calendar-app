# Progress Report

## What Works
- Month view fully implemented and functional
- Basic navigation between views (month/week/day)
- Shared CalendarNavigation component
- Event display in month view
- Authentication and session management
- Basic event creation and editing
- URL-based navigation and deep linking
- Consistent styling across views

## What's Left to Build
- Complete week view implementation
- Complete day view implementation
- Event creation/editing in week/day views
- Event dragging and resizing
- Current time indicators
- Event overlap handling
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Accessibility enhancements

## Current Status
- Navigation system refactored and improved
- Duplicate elements removed from views
- Shared components implemented
- Basic structure for week/day views in place
- Event display patterns established

## Known Issues
1. Event overlap not yet handled in week/day views
2. Mobile layout needs optimization
3. Keyboard navigation not fully implemented
4. No visual indicator for current time
5. Limited accessibility features
6. No event dragging/resizing yet

## Recent Achievements
- Implemented shared CalendarNavigation component
- Removed duplicate navigation elements
- Standardized navigation patterns
- Improved code organization
- Cleaned up component imports

## Technical Debt
1. Need to implement proper error boundaries
2. Event caching system needed for performance
3. Type definitions need refinement
4. Test coverage needed for new components
5. Need to optimize event rendering
6. Documentation updates required for new components
