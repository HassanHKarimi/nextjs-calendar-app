Latest commit: 91d3616 (Fix event-modal import paths for Vercel deployment)
This file helps ensure Vercel deploys the latest version with:
1. Separate build shell script to avoid Vercel's command length limits
2. Creation of stub event-modal component in multiple locations to resolve imports
3. Improved placement of event-modal.js in pages/calendar/utils to match relative imports
4. Enhanced shell script debugging for troubleshooting deployment issues
5. Removal of all conflicting App Router files
6. Removal of problematic auth directory
