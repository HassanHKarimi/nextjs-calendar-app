This file was added to trigger a new deployment on Vercel.
Latest commit: f396f7a (Use ultra minimal build scripts that just delete problem files)
This file helps ensure Vercel deploys the latest version with:
1. Ultra minimal pre-build script that just deletes problematic directories
2. No special characters, complex logic, or regex patterns
3. No file restoration - simplifies the whole process
4. No import path manipulation - removes complexity
5. Updated vercel-build script to explicitly run post-build
