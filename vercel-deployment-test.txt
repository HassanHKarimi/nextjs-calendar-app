Latest commit: cbfe70e (Replace with minimal pre-build script without special characters)
This file helps ensure Vercel deploys the latest version with:
1. Completely simplified pre-build and post-build scripts
2. No special characters or escape sequences
3. Direct file copying instead of complex operations
4. Simpler import path management
5. No complex regex patterns - just basic string operations
